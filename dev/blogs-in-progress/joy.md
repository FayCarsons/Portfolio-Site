# Developing a functional creative codng library in OCaml

I have taken a unique path during my short time as a developer. Beginning with
Clojure, with which I mostly wrote (ShaderToy)[shadertoy.com] style shader 
sketches, then moving onto Rust and now MLs: I have felt lost, confounded or 
otherwise confused at many points. The resources for absolute beginners in these 
spaces are few and far between. Its generally accepted that these are 'hard' 
languages(something I don't agree with) and that people who are brand new to 
computer science should start with imperative languages like Python or 
Javascript. I find this frustrating for a few reasons, one of which is the 
likeliness that this is the cause of those languages popularity vs functional 
languages.

So, when I was offered the opportunity to intern for (Tarides)[https://tarides.com],
building a creative coding library that would be designed for computer science 
education, I immediately accepted.
