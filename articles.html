          Hi! My name is Fay Carsons, I am a self-taught developer living in the
          southern USA. My focuses include creative coding, functional
          languages, web design, and low-level optimization. In my free time I
          make music with my modular synthesizers and teach myself embedded
          systems. <br /><br />
          My core values are curiosity, perseverance, and excellence in
          everything that I do. <br /><br />
        </p>
        <p>
          I am deeply fascinated by software, the theory behind it, the math
          involved, and the ways in which we can translate these elements into
          new and exciting art and digital experiences. <br /><br />

          Coming from a somewhat unique background, not being a college
          graduate, having little formal education in math and none in computer
          science, and having faced significant hardship in my life, learning to
          code and achieving my goals as a programmer has been difficult at
          times. Through perseverance, I have achieved more than I ever could
          have imagined and that brings me a great deal of joy. <br /><br />

          And finally, excellence is crucial to me. In everything that I do, I
          the final product to be something I am proud of. In the context
          of software, all the tools necessary to write performant, efficient,
          elegant programs are within reach so I prioritize those things. I
          think a lot of modern software is bloated and inefficient, making user
          experience difficult and frustrating, particularly for people with
          less computational resources or disabilities. <br /><br />

          I wanted to join outreachy because I wanted to become a better
          programmer. I want to write better code, learn how to manage larger
          projects, and get comfortable working with a team of people on a
          shared goal. I'm very excited for what's to come!
