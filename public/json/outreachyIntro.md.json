  "body": "<p class=\"font-mono text-sm my-4 mx-auto\" >Hi! My name is Fay Carsons, I am a self-taught developer living in the southern USA. My focuses include creative coding, functional languages, web design, and performance + efficiency. In my free time I make music with my modular synthesizers and teach myself synthesizer design.</p>\n<p class=\"font-mono text-sm my-4 mx-auto\" >My core values are curiosity, perseverance, and excellence in everything that I do.</p>\n<p class=\"font-mono text-sm my-4 mx-auto\" >I am deeply fascinated by software, the theory behind it, the math involved, and the ways in which we can translate these elements into new and exciting art and digital experiences.</p>\n<p class=\"font-mono text-sm my-4 mx-auto\" >Coming from a somewhat unique background, not being a college graduate, having little formal education in math and none in computer science, and having faced significant hardship in my life, learning to code and achieving my goals as a programmer has been difficult at times. Through perseverance, though, I have done more than I ever would have imagined. Had creative coding projects sell out, my art shown in other countries, built websites, rendering engines, and synthesizers from scratch.</p>\n<p class=\"font-mono text-sm my-4 mx-auto\" >And finally, excellence is crucial to me. In everything that I do I want to create something that I can truly be proud of. In the context of software, all the tools necessary to write performant, efficient, elegant programs are within reach so I prioritize those things. I think a lot of modern software is bloated and inefficient, making user experience difficult and frustrating, particularly for people with less computational resources or disabilities that affect how they interact with computers.</p>\n<p class=\"font-mono text-sm my-4 mx-auto\" >I wanted to join outreachy because I wanted to become a better programmer. I want to write better code, learn how to manage larger projects, and get comfortable working with a team of people on a shared goal. I'm very excited for what's to come!</p>"
