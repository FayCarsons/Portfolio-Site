# Outreachy blog 1: Introduce yourself!

Hi! My name is Fay Carsons, I am a self-taught developer living in the southern USA. My focuses include creative coding, functional languages, web design, and performance + efficiency. In my free time I make music with my modular synthesizers and teach myself synthesizer design.

My core values are curiosity, perseverance, and excellence in everything that I do.

I am deeply fascinated by software, the theory behind it, the math involved, and the ways in which we can translate these elements into new and exciting art and digital experiences. 

Coming from a somewhat unique background, not being a college graduate, having little formal education in math and none in computer science, and having faced significant hardship in my life, learning to code and achieving my goals as a programmer has been difficult at times. Through perseverance, though, I have done more than I ever would have imagined. Had creative coding projects sell out, my art shown in other countries, built websites, rendering engines, and synthesizers from scratch. 

And finally, excellence is crucial to me. In everything that I do I want to create something that I can truly be proud of. In the context of software, all the tools necessary to write performant, efficient, elegant programs are within reach so I prioritize those things. I think a lot of modern software is bloated and inefficient, making user experience difficult and frustrating, particularly for people with less computational resources or disabilities that affect how they interact with computers.

I wanted to join outreachy because I wanted to become a better programmer. I want to write better code, learn how to manage larger projects, and get comfortable working with a team of people on a shared goal. I'm very excited for what's to come!
